# 🎬 Netflix Landing Page Clone  

A **Netflix landing page clone** built with **pure HTML & CSS**.  
This is my **first ever web development project**, where I combined all my initial learnings in HTML & CSS to recreate a real-world UI.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The aim of this project was to **practice fundamentals** and learn how to structure and style a large-scale webpage with precision.  

For this version, I focused on:  
- Positioning elements with fixed units  
- Structuring sections cleanly in HTML  
- Practicing CSS selectors (universal, element, ID, class)  
- Creating a visually close clone of the Netflix landing page  

⚠️ **Note:** This version is **not responsive** because I built it with fixed units to maintain pixel-perfect precision. Making it responsive would require restructuring most of the CSS — which I plan to tackle in future projects as my next milestone.
